I want it to start with a blank space where the data goes, we can provide a screen shot in the docs. It's confusing to have something in the box when it says "0 new feed items.:"

code for a feedland socket client, cribbed from the readerland base.

the goal is to get something that can be included in a browser JS app that gets it a flow of new and updated feed items.

initially we use the socket handler in feedlandHome, but I think ultimately we want to move that code down to this level so we only have one set of functions for all our apps, including the example app. 

this means moving the recentIds functionality into wsConnectUserToServer.
